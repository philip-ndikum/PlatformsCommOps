# **PlatformsCommOps**

Documentation and tools for secure communication operations and infrastructure management. This repository focuses on implementing reliable, scalable, and private communication platforms, including Mattermost, to ensure control over sensitive information and support organizational efficiency. 

Here’s a concise table at the start of the README to outline **CommOps Practices**, emphasizing secure and scalable operations:

## **CommOps Practices**

| **Practice**                                    | **Description**                                                                                   | **Benefit**                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Anonymous Email**                            | Use a secure and anonymous email (e.g., Proton Mail) for registration and an alias for service accounts. | Protects personal identity and minimizes exposure to third-party providers.                 |
| **Self-Hosted Communication**                  | Host Mattermost on DigitalOcean for internal communications.                                      | Ensures complete control over data, enhances privacy, and avoids reliance on external hosts.|
| **Scalable Infrastructure**                    | Deploy infrastructure on DigitalOcean with the ability to scale resources as needed.             | Supports growing team requirements while keeping costs manageable.                          |
| **Data Privacy and Security**                  | Avoid sharing sensitive data with third-party services and ensure all communication stays encrypted. | Reduces risk of data breaches and protects proprietary information.                         |
